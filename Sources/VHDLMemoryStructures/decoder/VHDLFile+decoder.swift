/// Create a generic decoder.
extension VHDLFile {

    /// Create a generic decoder.
    /// 
    /// This initialiser creates a 32-bit decoder that assumes each element within the encoded 32-bit value
    /// contains an enable bit at it's suffix. For example, the element `"0110"` of length 4-bits would be
    /// immediately followed by a 1-bit enable bit `'1'`. The `elementSize` parameter should ignore this
    /// enable bit when calculating the size of each element.
    /// 
    /// For example, consider a 32-bit encoded value with 2 elements
    /// each of size 4-bits. The encoded value may be: `"11011000110000000000000000000000"`. The first element
    /// is `"1101` with enable bit `'1'`, and the second element is `"0001"` with enable bit `'1'`. All other
    /// entries are padding. The decoder will contain a `data` input and 4 outputs named `out0`, `out0en`,
    /// `out1`, and `out1en` representing the decoded elements and their enable bits respectively. Please note
    /// that the element starting at the most-significant bit of the encoded value is considered element 0.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - name: The name of the decoder.
    ///   - elements: The number of elements in the decoder.
    ///   - size: The size of each element in the decoder.
    /// - Warning: The `numberOfElements` and `elementSize` parameters must be greater than 0.
